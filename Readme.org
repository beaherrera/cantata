#+title: Cantata

* Introduction

Translate SONATA simulations to something Arbor can execute.
Requires a working installation of Rust (incl Cargo), Python, and Arbor (dev).
Checkout this repository, then

#+begin_src shell
$ cd cantata
$ cargo run -- build path/to/sonata/simulation.json out-dir
$ cd out-dir
$ python3 main.py
#+end_src

This will perform the translation and create a working (hopefully, this is an
alpha-grade project) simulation in the output directory ~out-dir~. Running the
simulation will generate the requested outputs (spikes and traces) in
~out-dir/out~. You may want/need to tweak the simulation.
